# Aircraft-crash-analysis--EDA
Analysis of historical aircraft crashes using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
This project was created to explore aircraft crash data and understand the factors associated with aviation accidents. It helped strengthen my understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Through this project, I gained insights into:

Aircraft manufacturing companies involved in crashes

The types of aircraft most frequently associated with incidents

Trends in crash frequency and fatalities over the years and many more
